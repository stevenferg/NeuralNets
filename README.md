# Simple Neural Network

My implementation of a simple neural network which implements training with gradient descent and predictions. The current inspiration and motivation behind this project is implementing concepts learned through the Deep Learning Specialization course offered through Coursera.

This neural net currently only implements the sigmoid activation function and predicts binary classification with plans to expand further.
